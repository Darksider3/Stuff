# LiGi-Apps

Currently, i'm just into one. I tend to accumulate many many many small projects, and would like to have one "big", where i can try myself out as hard as i can. This will be the library im trying to get up here.

The small projects will hopefully sometimes get bigger and bigger, with myself trying to do as much as i can to get them fully functional to some point i can finally call them "done".

So, im starting with a pomodoro ncurses timer. It's the technique im currently using, not really extensivly, but as much as i can. It fits me well in many aspects, especially GETTING SOMETHING DONE ACTUALLY.
Compilation & execution of it:
```
g++ --std=c++2a -g -pedantic-errors -Wall -Wpedantic -lncurses -lpthread ./timer.cpp && ./a.out
```
